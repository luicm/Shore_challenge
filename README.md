You're given a small app that fetches images from Flickr (http://www.flickr.com) and displays them in a grid. 

The app has a small problem where sometimes the images don't show up or the user has to tap on the display first before the images show up. 



You have the following tasks: 


1. Fix this bug.

2. Since the source code doesn't contain any data model objects, you need to introdude them.

3. Implement a feature, where clicking on a thumbnail opens the image in a full screen view and shows the image name.

4. Write unit tests for the data model object(s).

Notes: 

- Language: Objective-C for task #1
- Language: Swift for task #2, #3, #4 (Unit tests) 
- Use GIT for versioning
- Cocoapods is already integrated, use whatever 3rd party library you want
- Simulator only, doesn't have to run run on a device.
- Use the latest XCode available on the App Store


Clone the repository and send us link to the project when you're done.
